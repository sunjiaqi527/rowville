														SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. 
														While your strengths and weaknesses are internal to your business, threats and opportunities are external in the environment. 
														The main strategies behind SWOT analysis are: 
														<ul>
															<li>Strengthsâ€“Opportunities. Use your internal strengths to take advantage of opportunities. </li>
															<li>Strengths-Threats. Use your strengths to minimize threats. </li>
															<li>Weaknesses-Opportunities. Improve weaknesses by taking advantage of opportunities. </li>
															<li>Weaknesses-Threats. Work to eliminate weaknesses to avoid threats.<br>
